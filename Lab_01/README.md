# 🔢 C++ Lab – Foundational OOP Class Simulations

This C++ project consists of multiple independent classes, each simulating a basic concept of Object-Oriented Programming such as:

- ✅ Input/output with encapsulation (`Student`, `Product`, `Voter`)
- ✅ Basic calculations and validation (`Calculator`, `Rectangle`)

## 📂 Project Structure

```
.
├── main.cpp            # Testing all classes (currently set to run temperature module)
├── Calculator.h        # Simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations
├── Product.h           # Product class with setters, validation, and total price
├── Rectangle.h         # Area and perimeter calculation for rectangles
├── Student.h           # Student record management (name, roll, marks)
├── Temperature.h       # Menu-driven temperature converter (Celsius to Fahrenheit)
├── Voter.h             # Voter eligibility check by age
```

## 🚀 How to Compile and Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/oop-lab-simulations.git
   cd oop-lab-simulations
   ```

2. **Compile the code**:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o oop_lab
   ```

3. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   ./oop_lab
   ```

> 🔧 You can uncomment different sections in `main.cpp` to test various classes.

## 🧪 Highlights

- **Input Validation:** Product name, price, and quantity checks.
- **Encapsulation:** Data and logic are properly bundled in each class.
- **looped Validation** Implemented in the Product Class
