# 🧠 C++ OOP Concepts Simulator

These lab tasks demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++ using simple, interactive examples. It includes:
- ✅ Shallow Copy and Double Delete Problem`BankAccount` class
- ✅ Deep Copy demonstration using `UpdateBankAccount` class
- ✅ Single Inheritance with `Student` inheriting from `Person`
- ✅ Constructor behavior in inheritance with `ConstructInheritance` class
