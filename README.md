# üéì 2nd Semester C++ Lab Collection  
_A curated journey through Object-Oriented Programming in C++_

Welcome to my personal repository of C++ lab assignments from the 2nd semester of my Software Engineering journey.  
This collection reflects my hands-on practice, conceptual understanding, and growth in applying core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles using C++.

## üß† What's Inside?

A structured set of practical programming tasks designed to:

- Strengthen core C++ concepts
- Apply real-world OOP methodologies
- Build interactive, menu-driven console applications
- Understand memory management and class behavior

## üîç Lab Breakdown

### ‚úÖ Lab 1: Introduction to OOP  
_Explore the basics of classes, inheritance, and object creation._  
- Deep Copy simulation using user-defined classes  
- Single Inheritance with constructor chaining  
- Practical use of encapsulation and access specifiers  

### ‚úÖ Lab 2: Constructors & Memory Management  
_Dive into constructors, destructors, and object lifecycles._  
- Default and parameterized constructor usage  
- Destructor calls in stack vs heap allocation  
- Simulation of banking, employee, and locker systems  

### ‚úÖ Lab 3: Interactive Utilities & Validation  
_Build real-world tools using menus and input validation._  
- Menu-driven temperature converter (Celsius ‚Üí Fahrenheit)  
- Inventory & product management systems  
- Student record keeper, voter eligibility checker, and a simple calculator

## üöÄ How to Compile & Run

Each lab is self-contained and can be compiled independently using a C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o lab_output
./lab_output
üí° Tip: Navigate to the desired lab folder and uncomment the specific code blocks in main.cpp before compiling.


## üìå Learning Outcomes

- ‚úÖ Mastered class structures, objects, and methods

- ‚úÖ Practiced constructor overloading and data validation

- ‚úÖ Explored memory management and destructor behavior

- ‚úÖ Built real-world inspired utilities from scratch
